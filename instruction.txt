# Simplified Setup Instructions for Trading CLI on macOS

# 1. Prerequisites
#   - Install Homebrew (if you don't have it): Visit https://brew.sh
#   - Install GMP (a build dependency for some packages):
#     brew install gmp
#   - Ensure you have Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11. Check with: python3 --version
#     (If your system Python isn't suitable, consider using `pyenv` to install Python 3.11.x)

# 2. Project Setup & Virtual Environment
#   - Create a project directory (e.g., MyTradingCLI) and navigate into it:
#     mkdir ~/Desktop/MyTradingCLI && cd ~/Desktop/MyTradingCLI
#   - Create a virtual environment (uses your current `python3`):
#     python3 -m venv venv_cli
#   - Activate the virtual environment:
#     source venv_cli/bin/activate
#     (Your terminal prompt should now show "(venv_cli)")

# 3. Install Dependencies
#   - Inside the activated (venv_cli) virtual environment, run:
#     pip install x10-python-trading

# 4. Deploy & Run
#   - Copy your "CLI" application folder (containing cli.py, config.py, core/, strategies/) 
#     into your project directory (e.g., MyTradingCLI).
#   - Update API keys in CLI/config.py.
#   - Run the application (from your project directory, with (venv_cli) activated):
#     python CLI/cli.py

# --- To Stop ---
# - In the CLI application: type "exit".
# - In the Terminal: type "deactivate" (to exit the virtual environment).
